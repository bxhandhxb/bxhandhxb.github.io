> 1. Bayesian Networks Independencies in BNs

Types of three-variable structures: chain (aka causal trail or evidential trail), common parent (aka common cause), v-structure (aka common effect)

Property: A variable X is independent of its non-descendants given its parents

Property: A variable X is independent of all other variables in the network given its Markov blanket, which consists of its parents, its children, and its co-parents

> 2. Independencies in MRFs

Two variables X and Y are independent if there is no active trail between them; a trail is active if it doesnâ€™t contain any observed variables

Property: A variable X is independent of all other variables in the network given its Markov blanket, which consists of its direct neighbors in the graph
